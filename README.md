# 04 Server Side APIs - Weather Dashboard

## Task

This homework was to create a weather dashboard using server-side APIs. The main parts of this assignment required accessing two OpenWeather API and filling out the page with different data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Development

I compleated this project with Bootstrap, Moment and just a touch of jQuery. Filling out the pages and updating from the API was fairly simple, however, I got stuck on localStorage and took a long time to troubleshoot my problems.
